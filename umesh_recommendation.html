            <p>
                It gives me great pleasure to express my wholehearted support for Sarat’s application
                into your esteemed organization. As the founder of AuthBase, Sarat was directly working
                under me during his student internship with us. I met with him frequently to assign
                responsibilities and discuss the industry. I was especially impressed with Sarat's work ethics,
                initiatives and problem solving skills. During his internship Sarat became a valued member
                and a team player to his peers. I’m confident that he has a successful career in research
                and product development ahead of him.
            </p>

            <p>
                As an intern in our company, Sarat had a number of responsibilities. He worked with other
                members of his team, took lead in helping them understand the task given as well as building
                and integrating the products. Sarat has a keen learning ability faster than many and has an
                impeccable work ethics. We have a saying at our office its not one without the other but only
                with both intelligence or hard work that lets you achieve anything, Sarat is one such
                fine example.
            </p>

            <p>
                As an Undergrad at IIIT-Hyderabad, Sarat already had an understanding of various
                emerging technologies and it was very easy for us to build on that foundation. His ability
                for problem solving, development and debugging is quite potent. Sarat was working
                independently on his project along with helping others with theirs. Not only can he
                hold his own but he gives great inputs to his peers. He’s self-motivated, attentive to detail,
                and skilled at both independent and collaborative work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond his skills, Sarat left a mark with his open, thoughtful personality.
                He is well-spoken and intellectual, and he lights up when talking about ideas.
                A community of fellow developers, code lovers, technology builders and shapers
                is exactly where Sarat belongs. He will always have an open position with us.
            </p>

            <p>
                In closing, I’d like to reiterate my strong support for Sarat's application to
                the position applied in your esteemed organization. Sarat is a talented young man driven
                by a passion for technology and its up to us to expose such individuals to every possible
                future. Please don’t hesitate to contact me for any further information.
                Thank you for your time.
            </p>
